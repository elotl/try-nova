# Nova Quickstart

This README includes:
1. An installation guide for Nova on KIND clusters.
The scripts in this repo will allow you to create a sandbox environment for using Nova's trial version (for managing up to 3 workload clusters). If you are interested in using the full version, please contact us at info@elotl.co
2. Tutorials that walk you through the core functionalities of Nova.

We love feedback, so please feel free to ask questions by creating an issue in this repo, joining our Slack: [Elotl Free Trial](https://join.slack.com/t/elotl-free-trial/shared_invite/zt-1tciz8cck-H9Swzl2grCqPaLJeHYtbBQ) or writing to us at info@elotl.co

## Installation on KIND (Kubernetes in Docker) clusters

This script will allow you to create and configure 3 kind clusters - one of them will be the Nova Control Plane and the other two will be Nova workload clusters.

```sh
    $ ./scripts/setup_trial_env_on_kind.sh
```

Once installation finishes, you can use the following command to export Nova Control Plane kubeconfig as well as the kubeconfig of the hosting (or management) cluster and the workload clusters:

```sh
    $ export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/scripts/nova-installer-output/nova-kubeconfig:$PWD/kubeconfig-e2e-test-cp:$PWD/kubeconfig-e2e-test-workload-1:$PWD/kubeconfig-e2e-test-workload-2
```

This gives you access to Nova Control Plane (`nova` context), cluster hosting Nova Control Plane (context `kind-cp`) and two workload clusters (context `kind-workload-1` and `kind-workload-2`)

To interact with the Nova control plane, use `--context=nova` flag in kubectl commands, e.g.:

```sh
  $ kubectl --context=nova get clusters
```

To get more insight into the cluster's available resources:
```sh
  $ kubectl --context=nova get clusters -o go-template-file=./scripts/kubectl_templates/cluster_output.gotemplate
```
